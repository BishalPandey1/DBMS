A transaction is a set of logically related operations.
a transaction is a single logical action which accesses and modify the contents of the database
throught reading and write operations.


# simple transaction example:
1 Ready your account balace
2 Deduct the amount from your balace
3 Write the remaining balance to you account
4 Read you friend's account balance
5 Add the amount to his account balance
6 write the new updated balance to his account.
This whole set of operation(read, write , upadate) can be called a transaction. But transaction can 
have operations like read, write insert, update, delete.

for example let's take a simple transaction. suppose a bank employee transfer Rs 500 from A's 
account to B's account. This very simple and small transaction involves several low-level tasks.

A's Account:                                         B's account:
Opern_Account(A)                                     Open_Account(B)
Old_Balance =A.balance                               old_Balance =B.balance
New_Balance = Old_Balance - 500                       New_Balance = old_Balance + 500
A.balance = New_Balance                               B.balance = New_Balance
Close_Account (A)                                     Close_Account(B)
