The advantages of DBMS include data integrity, backup, data security, decision-making,
accessibility, and more.

Reduction in data Redundancy
When working with a structured database, DBMS provides the feature to prevent the input of
duplicate items in the database. for e.g. â€“ If there are two same students in different rows, then one
of the duplicate data will be deleted.

Efficient data access and retrieval
DBMS allows for efficient data access and retrieval by providing indexing and query optimization
techniques that speed up data retrieval. This reduces the time required to process large volumes of
data and increases the overall performance of the system.

Data sharing
A DBMS provides a platform for sharing data across multiple applications and users, which can
increase productivity and collaboration.

Improved Data Integrity and Consistency
One of the primary advantages of DBMS usage is its improved data integrity and consistency. A
DBMS enforces rules and constraints on the data, ensuring that all data is accurate and consistent.
For example, a DBMS can be programmed only to allow unique values in a specific field,
preventing duplicate entries. Additionally, DBMSs provide various tools for data validation, such
as check constraints and triggers, further enhancing the integrity of the data.

Enhanced Data Security
A DBMS acts like a highly secure bank vault safeguarding your precious valuables, such as your
data. It employs various security measures, such as encryption and access controls. It protects data
from unauthorized access, theft, or manipulation. This ensures that sensitive information remains
confidential and accessible only to individuals with the necessary permissions. Just like a bank
employs guards and surveillance systems to keep your assets safe. Similarly, a DBMS vigilantly
guards your data around the clock, providing peace of mind and fostering user trust.

Better Data Backup and Recovery
DBMSs offer various backup and recovery options, such as incremental backups and point-in-time
recovery. This ensures that data can be quickly restored during a failure. Additionally, it uses
techniques such as backups, replication, and journaling to ensure that the database's data can be
recovered in case of failure.

Scalability and flexibility
DBMS is highly scalable and can easily accommodate changes in data volumes and user
requirements. DBMS can easily handle large volumes of data, and can scale up or down depending
on the needs of the organization. It provides flexibility in data storage, retrieval, and manipulation,
allowing users to easily modify the structure and content of the database as needed.
